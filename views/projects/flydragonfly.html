    Fly-DragonFly was based on the old space arcade top down shooter games, with a slight twist: This time you are a
    dragonfly
    that has embarked on a journey to a new waterhole since your old home has become irradiated. Due to that irradiation
    you have gained an amazing ability from your herritage... Dragon Breath.

    After each level the player is scored on: How many times he was hit, how many creaters he was able to kill and the
    number
    of insects he has eaten.
