    Visualisation program for UCT PHD student <a href="http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~claidler/" target="_blank">Chris
    Laidler.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Chris's Masters &amp; PHD project and thesis is on a program that finds Binary Pulsars from radio telescope data. In
    order
    to determine if his algorithms work, and to actually visualise the pulsars, Chris asked if we could make a
    Visualisation
    program for him, as a visualisation course project.
</p>
<p>
    The visualiser can view the 5 dimensional radio telescope data in 3 ways: a 3D viewer, a 2D viewer and a graph (1D).
    <br>
    This is done by fixing dimensions on a single data point. By fixing 1 dimension, we cut the data to 4 dimensions
    which can
    be viewed in 3D space with the forth dimension displayed as colour. By fixing 2 dimensions we can display a 2D
    surface with the
    third dimension as colour. But by fixing 3 dimensions, this data can be represented as a graph since it leaves a
    single axis with
    "height" values.
</p>
<p>
    The program uses a seperate screen of uniquely placed sliders in order to choose which dimensions are fixed,
    how much of a dimension to display and how much colour or "heat" of the last dimension to display.
</p>
<p>
    Developed in Java and OpenGL.
